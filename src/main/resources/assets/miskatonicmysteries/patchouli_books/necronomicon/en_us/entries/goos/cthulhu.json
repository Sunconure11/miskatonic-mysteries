      "text": "It is possible the Dreamer’s sleepwalking is what inspired stories of great ocean beasts such as the leviathan in ancient times, and that the Dream’s latent aura is responsible for mankind’s anxiety of the deep and what hides within. The Dreamer has no avatars and does not appear to his followers in the flesh, but rather communicates to them through dreams to plant the seeds of his grand plan in their minds."
