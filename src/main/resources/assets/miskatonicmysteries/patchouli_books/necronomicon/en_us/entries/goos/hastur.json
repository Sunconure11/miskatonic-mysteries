      "text": "However, unlike the other Gods, he often has little interest in building up cults, though his very aura is known to harm people mentally, granting them with amazing artistic skills, but only as a way for them to express their painful madness. They often feel the need to spread the Sign far and wide, inducting others."

He may also appear in groups of people, as a strange shade that only appears, then to disappear, often followed by an outbreak of hysteria in the area."
