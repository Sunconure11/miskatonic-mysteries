      "text": "While often times congregating in dark unseen places, occasionally cultists will hold masses near Shrines or may be found in ancient libraries, trying to absorb any and all info on their chosen God they can. Cultists are often hostile to those who are not initiated, but a few are willing to spread their word and are neutral to the unaffiliated. Still, they are not exactly Entheators."

They often have goatish features, including satyr-like legs, though some more extreme cases have been reported. These individuals enjoy a greater connection to the wilds, along with a semi-immortal life."

While most are consumed by their mother shortly after their birth, a few are allowed to roam the darkest forests of the world, and often spread their motherâ€™s message and assist her worshippers in rites. When encountered, they seem to pass through the trees almost as if liquid, and attack prey with their multiple hooves and dendritic tentacles."
